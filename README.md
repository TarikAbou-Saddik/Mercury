## Running it locally

To run it locally, you'll have to do the following:

1. Clone the repository locally.
2. `cd` into the project directory and run `npm install`.
3. Once the dependencies have installed, you'll have to add the Netlify CLI (you can choose to do so globally): `npm install netlify-cli`
4. Once the install has completed, you can simply run `netlify dev` and Netlify will take care of proxying calls to the serveless functions used in this SPA and of also running the react-scripts that CRA comes with.
